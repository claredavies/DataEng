Instructions

1) Generate the Test Cases using the Instruction in the TestGenerationRestler folder

2) The above should generate a text file containing info about the test cases generated e.g. network.testing.3180.1.txt
    and rename it to restler_output.txt (needed for next step)
    
3) Follow Instructions in the ParseTests folder which will produce a test_cases_produced.csv (needed for next step)

4) Follow Instructions in the AnomalyDetection folder

Note - there is also a TestGenerationModel folder but the test generation model is not yet working (WIP)
