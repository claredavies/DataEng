Overall Instructions

1) Generate the Test Cases for Rester using the instructions in the TestGenerationRestler folder
2) The above should generate a text file containing info about the test cases generated e.g. network.testing.3180.1.txt
    and rename it to restler_output.txt 
3) Generate the Test Cases for Generative Model using the Instruction in the TestGenerationModel folder
4) The above should generate a text file containing info about the test cases generated. Make sure named generative_model_test_cases_produced.txt.
5) Follow Instructions in the ParseTestsAndAnalyse folder which will parse the restler_output.txt and generative_model_test_cases_produced.txt files and then         Analyse the results
   
Note - there is also a AnomalyDetection folder which produces results but they are not yet very effective (WIP)
